Rename Android app from nativeTest to Metronome :)
Refactor actions+reducers into their own folders 'n' stuff
Build for Android phone -> run on phone as app - DONE
  - Implement volume control - DONE
  - Stop the clicking noise (implement decay)
  - Investigate why sometimes the 1st note lasts longer then the rest; makes it
    all sounds broken
  - it overlayed two tracks at once? Investigate seemed to be related to leaving and coming back
Implement a line that moves across the notes to show where in the beat we are
Maybe pop out the note boxes?
Make and add Icon + correct app name
  - maybe get rid of the splash screen?
Think about and implement a way to show/hide queue lanes
